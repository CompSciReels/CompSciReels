# üë®‚Äçüíª CompSciReels

**`Digital Innovator (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**

I'm an indie software developer dedicated to spreading the joy of programming worldwide. I create projects in languages like Visual Basic, C++, C#, Java, and Swift, and I share all my code on GitHub. Each project inspires a new video that I post on "[CompSciReels][TikTok]" YouTube and TikTok.

I also make educational videos teaching computer science concepts on both platforms. My goal is to make programming education free and accessible to all. Additionally, I provide resources on scholarships, college choices, and programming project ideas, giving young adults the invaluable head start in tech they might not otherwise have received.
